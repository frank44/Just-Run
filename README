This is my first Windows 7 phone app. It was made during UHack, a hackathon hosted by the University of Miami. 

It essentially allows the user to start, stop, and save their runs. 
During the jog the user gets a real time velocity, distance, and time read outs. It also integrates with bing apps and uses the GPS to track and trace your location. 
The stats from these sessions can then be saved for future reference and comparison.
